## Tools Used
- **MXToolbox** – Email header, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC analysis  
- **urlscan.io** – URL behavior and redirect analysis  
- **VirusTotal** – Reputation-based threat scanning  
- **WHOIS** – Domain registration analysis  
- **Manual inspection** – Social engineering and content review  

---

## Analysis Performed
- Reviewed sender address, subject line, and email content
- Analyzed email authentication results (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- Investigated embedded URL behavior and redirect chain
- Identified social engineering techniques based on urgency and fear
- Validated domain ownership and hosting infrastructure

---

## Key Findings

### Email Authentication
- **SPF:** SoftFail — sending IP not authorized
- **DKIM:** Pass — message signed by sender domain
- **DMARC:** Pass — valid DMARC policy exists

Although DKIM and DMARC passed, the email originated from a domain unrelated to Yahoo, indicating brand impersonation using a properly authenticated but malicious domain.

### URL & Domain Analysis
- **Primary URL (defanged):**  
  hxxps://7i7s[.]com/4ykaoY21813zuow120wiiztjxpgx128...

- Hosted behind Cloudflare with WHOIS privacy enabled
- Redirect chain included legitimate third-party domains
- No malware detected via VirusTotal

The presence of legitimate domains in the redirect chain appears to be used for obfuscation and detection evasion.

---

## Verdict
This email was classified as **malicious phishing** based on:
- Brand impersonation of Yahoo
- SPF authentication failure
- Deceptive sender domain
- Obfuscated URL structure
- Social engineering designed to create urgency and fear

---

## Recommended Response
- Block sender domain and associated IPs
- Remove the email from affected mailboxes
- Educate users on phishing indicators
- Monitor for similar impersonation campaigns
